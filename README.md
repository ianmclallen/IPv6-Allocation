# IPv6 Allocation

## Introduction
While reading about IPv6 and the different address allocation methods I started looking for scripts that others may have written to help me out in doing my own IPv6 Address Plan. Sadly I had a hard time finding some, so I decided to start this repository and start scriptiong some of these methods out.

I have focused on 3 ways to do IPv6 address allocation: 
* Next available
* Random (coming soon)
* Sparse (coming soon)

My hope is that this will help others and save them some time.
